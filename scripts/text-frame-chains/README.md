# Text frame chaining

Create a Scribus document:

- With a longer text (the Odyssey, about 350 A5 pages).
- It first creates the document with a single page and the whole text, loaded from the text file in this folder.
- It then creates one page after the other, adding a full page text frame that is then linked to the text frame in the previous page.
